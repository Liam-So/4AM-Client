                  The goal of the 4AM Camp is to honour Andrew's legacy by <br/>
                  paying his impact forward to the next generation of basketball players. <br/>
                  <br/>
                  All of the proceeds from the camp go towards an annual award in Andrew's name. <br/>
                  <br/>
                  Given Andrew's involvement in the Basketball Nova Scotia Provincial Teams,<br/>
                  Andrewâ€™s family decided the award should be given to a BNS athlete. <br/>
                  <br/>
                  The 4AM Award considers three aspects in the selection of the recipient: <br/>
                  financial need, burden of travel (cost and time), and character.
