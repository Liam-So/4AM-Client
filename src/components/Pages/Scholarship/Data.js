      "Coby played for Riverview High School in Cape Breton. The $4000 award helped fund his summer of basketball on the BNS U17 Team. We could not be more proud to have Coby as the first ever recipient of the award - he's a phenomenal basketball player, but more importantly, his character embodies Andrew's. Coby travelled from Cape Breton to attend the 2nd Annual 4AM Camp.",
